# This configuration file instructs Netlify on how to build and deploy

# This section defines the commands and directories for the build process.

  # The command to build the project. We use 'pnpm build' as per our sacred rituals.

  # The directory that contains the production-ready static files after the build.
  # For Vite projects, this is typically 'dist'.

  # Specifies the Node.js version to use for the build.
  # This ensures consistency with our development environment.

# --- Redirects and Rewrites ---
# This section handles routing rules for the deployed site.

# Rule for Single Page Application (SPA) routing.
# This is the most crucial rule for a React application using React Router.
# It ensures that any request that doesn't match a static file in the 'dist'
# directory is rewritten to serve 'index.html'. This allows React Router
# to handle all client-side navigation correctly.
