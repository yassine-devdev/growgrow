# Code Requirements and Guidelines

## Core Requirements
Rewrite this code with fully working logic. Do not use null, undefined, any, unknown, void, scaffold, placeholder, or incomplete constructs. Every variable must be initialized with real values. Every function must return a valid result. Every module must be imported correctly. If any logic is missing, complete it with real-world behavior. Do not leave anything unimplemented or symbolic. The final code must run without errors and reflect production-grade logic.

## Project Context
- **Project Type**: Full-stack SaaS platform
- **Language**: TypeScript
- **Framework**: React + Node.js + Prisma
- **Goal**: Real-world execution. No dummy logic. No missing folders. No ceremonial shortcuts. No undefined values.

## Quality Standards
- All code must be type-safe and follow TypeScript best practices
- Implement proper error handling and logging
- Include comprehensive test coverage
- Follow established naming conventions
- Document all public APIs and complex logic
- Ensure security best practices are implemented
- Optimize for performance and scalability
